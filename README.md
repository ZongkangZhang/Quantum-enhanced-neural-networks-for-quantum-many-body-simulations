# Quantum-enhanced neural networks for quantum many-body simulations
These codes are accompanied to the following paper:

  * Zongkang Zhang, Ying Li, Xiaosi Xu, Quantum-enhanced neural networks for quantum many-body simulations.

## Requirement
These codes are written in Python. We implement the neural networks in PyTorch, construct the quantum circuits with PennyLane, and generate the molecular Hamiltonians using OpenFermion.
